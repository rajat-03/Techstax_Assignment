# Techstax Assessment: Workflow Builder Application

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive workflow builder application that uses React.js and Node.js. Users can visually create workflows for basic data manipulation tasks and easily execute them.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Navigate to the backend directory.
6. Start the backend server:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

6. Access the application in your web browser.

## Technology Stack

- _Frontend:_

  - React.js: Used for building the user interface and workflow creation functionality.
  - ReactFlow: Provides a drag-and-drop interface for constructing workflows.

- _Backend:_
  - Node.js: Employs Express.js for backend server implementation, handling workflow execution and data processing.
  - Database: Utilizes MongoDB for storing workflow definitions, providing scalability and data persistence.
